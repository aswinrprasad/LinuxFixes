Telegram Fix in Ubuntu 17.04
===

### ABOUT :
This is a bug that I encountered when I Installed telegram to my Ubuntu 17.04. The Telegram Icon seems to be missing in all searches and command line 'Telegram' in Terminal does not launch Telegram too.

This was the commands I used to install Telegram.

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/telegram 
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install telegram -y

### FIX :
1.Download the script from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6tK150jyMyOb3ZVby1NTGNkUWM/view?usp=sharing) and execute it.
To do this :

	chmod +x Tele.sh
	./Tele.sh

2.There you go. The bug has been fixed and Telegram Installed.
